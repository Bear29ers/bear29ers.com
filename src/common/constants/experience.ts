          'During my time at university, I was working on my own animation videos, and when I was struggling to find an opportunity to promote my work, I received an invitation from a friend. I also sympathized with the desire to create new opportunities for junior and senior high school students, so I participated as a mentor and was mainly in charge of the video editing course.',
          'In order to provide junior and senior high school students with an opportunity to experience IT technology during the long vacation period of junior and senior high school students, I participated in 3-5 day IT camp events held at universities all over Japan as a mentor in various places such as Tokyo and Fukuoka, in addition to camps in Kansai, where I am based.',
          'In addition to being a mentor, I also participated in some of the events as a photographer, taking pictures of the students having fun and livening up the entire events.',
          'I also worked as a CA (class assistant) for a biweekly school for about a year and a half in total, supporting the entire class. This is different from a camp, and is a course in which junior and senior high school students work with mentors over a long period of time to develop and release an application, and basically they learn the basics thoroughly to develop one application throughout the year. At this school, I was in charge of behind-the-scenes support (attendance management, counseling for junior and senior high school students, preparing materials for each course, photographer, preparing for recitals, etc.) to ensure that classes ran smoothly.',
          'In this role, I used my strengths in video editing and design to create an original video and share the opening video for the recital held on the last day of the class.',
          'I also worked for about half a year as a management staff member for "Life is Tech! Leaders," a mentor training program for university students, to inspire university students who have the ambition to give back to junior and senior high school students the same techniques and skills as I did.',
